# Information Security Encryption Task

## Introduction üëã
This repository is used for doing encryption on a image, pdf, or a video, assigned by mr. Baskoro Adi on Information Security Course on ITS Surabaya. This project is created to fulfill assignment 1 in Information Security class. The objective of this project is to create a simple Web Storage App. The App will have the ability to store user‚Äôs private data in a database, and also any type of user‚Äôs file, such as user‚Äôs ID Card image, PDF/DOC/XLS files, video files, etc. The stored data in the server will be encrypted with AES, RC4, or DES algorithm, depending on the user‚Äôs preference. However, users can still retrieve their own data after being decrypted. Any users will be able to see all of the files (only the name and the owner is visible), but they can only download their own file. For the authentication, users can register their account by  submitting their name, email and password, and also it is mandatory to input their ID Card as well. The purpose of this assignment is to compare each encryption algorithm by comparing their encryption/decryption speed.
